Lightome is a lightweight serial to OSC bridge for communication with the Monome.  It is written in C and does not require Zeroconf or the Max runtime.  This project is a work in progress and will not currently function correctly (for users other than me) without changes to the source.

To compile on OS X:
1) Install liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
2) Run: gcc -Wall main.c -o lightome -llo -framework CoreFoundation

To compile on Linux (untested):
1) Install liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
2) Run: gcc -Wall main.c -o lightome -llo

Todo:
- Allow operation with - and detection of - any Monome
- Complete implementation of the Monome serial protocol
