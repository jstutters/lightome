# About
#

Lightome is a lightweight serial to OSC bridge for communication with the Monome.  It is written in C and does not require Zeroconf or the Max runtime.  This project is a work in progress and will not currently function correctly (for users other than me) without changes to the source.

#
# Building
#

To compile on OS X:
1) Install liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
2) Run: gcc -Wall main.c -o lightome -llo -framework CoreFoundation

To compile on Linux (untested):
1) Install liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
2) Run: gcc -Wall main.c -o lightome -llo

#
# Usage
#

Lightome supports the following commandline options:
-i [port] TCP port to listen on
-o [port] TCP port to send on
-p [/path/to/monome_tty] path to the Monome TTY
-h print a summary of the commandline options

When buttons are pushed on the Monome Lightome will send an OSC message to /lightome/press with arguments for the x any y position of the button pressed

When a button is released Lightome will send an OSC message to /lightome/release with the x and y positions of the button

To light up an LED on the Monome send a message to /lightome/led_on with the x and y positions of the LED to be lit

To switch off an LED, send a message to /lightome/led_off with the x and y positions

To clear or turn on the LEDs, send a message to /lightome/clear with either a 1 integer to turn on the LEDs or a 0 to turn them off.

# Todo

- Complete implementation of the Monome serial protocol
- Allow the user to specify the OSC prefix
